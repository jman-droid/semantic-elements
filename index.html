       <h2>About the movement</h2>
       <p>The prison abolition movement is a network of groups and activists that seek to reduce or eliminate prisons and the prison system, and replace them with systems of rehabilitation that do not place a focus on punishment and government institutionalization.</p>


        <article class="Theses">
          <h3>Dorothy Roberts ascribed three basic theses:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Today’s carceral punishment system can be traced back to slavery and the racial capitalist regime it relied on and sustained.</li>
            <li>The expanding criminal punishment system functions to oppress black people and other politically marginalized groups in order to maintain a racial capitalist regime.</li>
            <li>We can imagine and build a more humane and democratic society that no longer relies on caging people to meet human needs and solve social problems.</li>
          </ol>
              <p>Thus, Roberts situates the theory of prison abolition within an intellectual tradition including scholars such as Cedric Robinson, who developed the concept of racial capitalism, and characterizes the movement as a response to a long history of oppressive treatment of black people in the United States.</p>

            <p> <strong>Black & Pink</strong> is a prison abolitionist organization dedicated to abolishing the criminal punishment system and liberating LGBTQIA2S+ people and people living with HIV/AIDS who are affected by that system through advocacy, support, and organizing.</p>

         <h3>History of Prison Abolition</h3>
           <p>
             Joseph Smith, as part of his campaign for President of the United States in 1844, included "Abolish[ing] the cruel custom of prisons (except certain cases) [and] penitentiaries ... and let reason and friendship reign over the ruins of ignorance and barbarity; yea, I would, as the universal friend of man, open the prisons, open the eyes, open the ears, and open the hearts of all people, to behold and enjoy freedom—unadulterated freedom..."

             Angela Davis traces the roots of contemporary prison abolition theory at least to Thomas Mathiesen's 1974 book The Politics of Abolition, which had been published in the wake of the Attica Prison uprising and unrest in European prisons around the same time. She also cites activist Fay Honey Knopp's 1976 work Instead of Prisons: A Handbook for Abolitionists as significant in the movement.

             Eduardo Bautista Duran and Jonathan Simon point out that George Jackson's 1970 text Soledad Brother drew global attention to the conditions of prisons in the United States and made prison abolition a tenet of the New Left.

             Liz Samuels observes that, following the Attica Prison uprising, activists began to coalesce around a vision of abolition, whereas previously they had endorsed a program of reform.
